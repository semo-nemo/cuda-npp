# laplaceFilterNPP - Laplace Filter with NPP

## Description

A NPP CUDA Sample that demonstrates how to use NPP LaplaceBox function to perform a Laplace Filter.

## Key Concepts

Performance Strategies, Image Processing, NPP Library
  
## Build and Run
 
### Linux
The Linux samples are built using makefiles. To use the makefiles, change the current directory to the sample directory you wish to build, and run make:
```
$ cd <sample_dir>
$ make clean build
$ make run
```
